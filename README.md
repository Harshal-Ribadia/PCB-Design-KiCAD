Arduino Nano Control Board

This project is a KiCad 9.0 PCB design for a simple control board based on the Arduino Nano.
It integrates an LCD display, I²C communication header, user input buttons, and an LED indicator, making it suitable for small embedded systems and learning projects.

Features

Arduino Nano socket (THT) — easy placement and replacement of the Nano module.

LCD display header (custom footprint, THT) — simple connection to a standard character LCD.

I²C header (custom footprint, THT) — breakout for SCL and SDA lines, enabling easy expansion with sensors and modules.

User interface components:

1 × LED (status indicator).

3 × push buttons (user inputs).

Design Details

Designed in KiCad 9.0 using the Footprint Editor for custom connectors.

All components are through-hole (THT) for easier prototyping and soldering.

Clear layout intended for beginners to practice PCB design, fabrication, and assembly.
